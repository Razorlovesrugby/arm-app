- Decisions pending: None

### Paste this at the start of next session
"Continuing ARM Phase 4 from CP-4.1. Phases 1–3 complete and deployed. Supabase has all 6 tables. The app has: auth, nav shell, PWA setup, and a fully working Roster tab (list, search, filter, add/edit/delete, CSV export) at https://arm-app-black.vercel.app. Phase 4 builds the Depth Chart tab: vertical position columns (Prop → Unspecified), drag-to-reorder within columns using dnd-kit, player order persisted in depth_chart_order table, tapping a player opens the Edit Player form."

---

## Session Summary — Phase 4 Complete — 2026-03-27

### Phase 4 — Depth Chart — Completed

- CP-4.1 — `useDepthChart` hook: parallel fetch of players + depth_chart_order, merges into 11 `PositionColumn` objects (explicit order first, unordered players appended alphabetically). Includes optimistic `updateOrder` with Supabase upsert + rollback on failure.
- CP-4.2 — `DepthChart.tsx` renders 11 horizontally scrollable position columns with compact player chips (name + status badge), player count badge per column, loading spinner, error state.
- CP-4.3 + CP-4.4 — dnd-kit drag-to-reorder within each column. Each column has its own `DndContext` with PointerSensor + TouchSensor (200ms touch delay to avoid scroll conflict). Optimistic update fires immediately; Supabase upserts new order; rolls back on error. Visual drag feedback: purple border, shadow, 50% opacity.
- CP-4.5 — Tap player name opens `PlayerFormSheet` in edit mode (reuses Phase 3 component). Depth chart refetches after save.

**New files this phase:**
- `src/hooks/useDepthChart.ts`
- `supabase/seed_players.sql` (33 test players for QA)

**Modified files:**
- `src/pages/DepthChart.tsx` (stub → full implementation)

## Session Summary — Phase 5 Complete — 2026-03-27

### PRD version confirmed
- PRD v1.7 (Final) read in full. Used as source of truth.

  - `submitted_primary_position` + `submitted_secondary_positions` columns in `availability_responses` (migration 004 added)
  - Availability form field order confirmed: Name → Phone → Availability → Positions → Note (Phase 6)

### Phase 5 — Weeks Tab — Completed

- CP-5.1 — `useWeeks` hook: fetches all weeks with nested `week_teams`, exposes `openWeeks`/`closedWeeks` derived lists, `createWeek` function (inserts week + auto-inserts 5 `week_teams` rows + generates UUID token via `crypto.randomUUID()`). Refetches after create.
- CP-5.2 — Weeks tab renders week list: label, date range, Open/Closed status badge. Auto-selects most recent open week on load. Shows "No weeks yet" empty state with CTA.
- CP-5.3 — Create Week form: bottom sheet (mobile) / centred modal (desktop). Date pickers for start + end date (defaults to current Mon–Sun). Auto-generated label ("Week of 17 Mar") updates live from start date unless user edits manually. Validation on save. Creates week + 5 `week_teams` rows in Supabase.
- CP-5.4 — Link panel on week detail card (open weeks only): URL pill display, Copy Link button (clipboard, 2s "Copied!" feedback), Share button (native `navigator.share` with pre-formatted message: "Belsize Park RFC — [label]. Please submit your availability for this week: [URL]. Takes 30 seconds, no login needed."). Fallback to clipboard copy if `navigator.share` not available.
- CP-5.5 — Week dropdown switcher: compact `<select>` showing all weeks (label + status). Auto-populates. All-weeks list rendered below active week card when 2+ weeks exist.
- CP-5.6 — Migration `004_availability_positions.sql`: adds `submitted_primary_position` (TEXT) and `submitted_secondary_positions` (JSONB) to `availability_responses`. Ready to apply before Phase 6.

### PRD version confirmed
- PRD v1.8 read in full. Used as source of truth for Phase 6.

### Phase 6 — Schema Migration + Availability Form — Completed

- CP-6.1 — Migration 005: renamed `availability_responses.note → availability_note`, expanded `players.status` CHECK to include `Archived`, created `archive_game_notes` table (with partial unique index + RLS). TypeScript types updated: `PlayerStatus += Archived`, `AvailabilityResponse.note → availability_note`, `ArchiveGameNote` interface added, `PLAYER_STATUSES += Archived`. Roster: `showArchived` toggle (Archived hidden by default, purple checkbox in filter panel, included in activeFilters count, `clearFilters` resets it). `PlayerCard` Archived badge colour fixed (`#374151`).
- CP-6.2–6.5 — `AvailabilityForm.tsx` (full rewrite from stub, 595 lines): token resolution via anon Supabase query (invalid / closed / open states); form fields in PRD order (name → phone → availability card-radio → positions hidden when Unavailable → availability_note); submit logic: phone match → name ilike match → auto-create (Unspecified / Open / Active, placeholder email + DOB); position sync on Available submissions only; stores `availability_note` + `submitted_primary_position` + `submitted_secondary_positions`; success screen with player first name + availability label; 16px inputs (prevents iOS zoom); safe-area-inset padding.

**New / modified files:**
- `supabase/migrations/005_phase6.sql` (new)

"Continuing ARM Phase 7 from CP-7.1. Phases 1–6 complete. The app has auth, nav shell, PWA, Roster (full CRUD + CSV + Archived toggle), Depth Chart (drag-to-reorder), Weeks tab (create, UUID token, share), and a fully working public Availability Form (/availability/:token — token lookup, player match/auto-create, position sync, availability_note, success screen). Live at https://arm-app-black.vercel.app. Phase 7 builds the Selection Board: mobile (available players list + team dropdown assign + swipe between teams + drag-to-reorder within team) and tablet/desktop (full multi-column drag-drop). Player overlay shows Coach Notes (editable) + Availability Note for the current week (read-only)."

## Session Summary — Phase 7 Complete — 2026-03-28

### PRD version confirmed
- PRD v1.8 read in full. Used as source of truth for Phase 7.

### Phase 7 — Selection Board — Completed

- CP-7.1 — `useSelectionBoard` hook: parallel fetch of players (non-archived), availability_responses (latest per player via DESC order), week_teams, team_selections for the selected weekId. Derives `unassignedPlayers` (Available/TBC/no-response, sorted Available-first then TBC then no-response, then alpha). Exposes `assignPlayer`, `removePlayer`, `reorderTeam`, `movePlayer` with optimistic updates + Supabase upsert (ON CONFLICT week_id,week_team_id) + fetchData rollback on error.
- CP-7.2 — Mobile unassigned list: `AssignRow` component — player name/position, availability badge, "Add to" dropdown showing all 5 teams. Assign calls `assignPlayer` and player moves to team view immediately.
- CP-7.3 — Mobile swipe: left/right arrow nav + dot indicator bar. Views cycle: Unassigned → Team 1 → Team 2 → … → Team 5. Dot click navigates directly.
- CP-7.4 — Mobile drag-to-reorder: `MobileTeamView` uses dnd-kit `SortableContext` + `useSortable` per player. TouchSensor with 200ms delay. Starters / Reserves sections split at `starters_count`. Persisted via `reorderTeam` on drag end.
- CP-7.5 — Desktop multi-column drag-drop: `DndContext` wraps all columns. `useDroppable` per column (including unassigned). Cross-team moves call `movePlayer`. Same-team reorder calls `reorderTeam`. `DragOverlay` renders dragged chip. `DesktopUnassignedColumn` is droppable — dropping a team player here calls `removePlayer`.
- CP-7.6 — `PlayerOverlay`: bottom sheet (mobile) / centred modal (desktop). Shows Coach Notes (editable textarea + Save button, saves to `players.notes`). Shows Availability Note (read-only, yellow callout, hidden if none submitted, labelled "Availability Note — Week of [label]"). Player info row shows status / type / secondary positions.
- CP-7.7 — Integration: `SelectionBoard` + `PlayerOverlay` wired into `Weeks.tsx`. Board renders below `WeekDetail` for open weeks only. `useSelectionBoard` called with `weekId = null` for closed/no weeks (hook no-ops). Commit: `8e39d8f`.

**Note on swipe gesture:** Implemented as arrow-nav + dot indicator rather than touch-swipe gesture. Actual swipe can be added in Phase 12 polish.

**New files:**
- `src/hooks/useSelectionBoard.ts`
- `src/components/SelectionBoard.tsx`
- `src/components/PlayerOverlay.tsx`

**Modified files:**
- `src/pages/Weeks.tsx`

### Infrastructure note
- GitHub push blocked by VM network proxy (same as prior phases).
- **Action required:** Run `git push origin main` from terminal. Commit: `8e39d8f`.
- No new Supabase migrations required for Phase 7.

### Current state

- All changes committed locally: Yes
- Pushed to GitHub: **No — requires manual push**
- Tests passing: N/A

### Next session starts at
- **CP-8.1** — Auto-remove: Unavailable submission removes player from team_selections for that week (app-level logic triggered on availability form submit)
- Then: **CP-9.1** — Close Week: confirmation dialog, set Closed, update last_played fields, auto-insert archive_game_notes rows
- Files to touch: `src/pages/AvailabilityForm.tsx` (Phase 8), `src/pages/Weeks.tsx` + new close-week logic (Phase 9)
- Decisions pending: None

### Paste this at the start of next session
